8Jan02 - eurijk@zefga.net
	Added a corny /kick implementation. At some point this needs to pass
	through the msgqueue.
30Dec02 - eurijk@zefga.net
	Optimizations in sha can produce undesirable results. Freak case bug fixes.
29Dec02 - eurijk@zefga.net
	Reverted to old database. User password creation works. Fixed bug of
	too many connection free's.
27Dec02 - eurijk@zefga.net
	Moon made a ton of changes >;-) Logins work, channel joins, channel text,
	etc. *poke poke*, update the changelog >;-). Fixed a few strange things
	for gcc. Disabled all the hexdumps. Added debug() so we can isolate strange
	case segfaults. Fixed some threading issues.
22Dec02 - eurijk@zefga.net
	Added sha1, fixes for FreeBSD
21Dec02 - eurijk@zefga.net
	Moved us over to cvs, added some info to README about this. Added poppkt.
	Added some const fixes. Added a cheezy db so we have something to start
	from. We should be able to make a much better db in the future. :) Added
	msgqueue, so we can queue msg's to users and eventually between servers.
21Dec02 - moonshine
	Packids.h now contains all game-related protocol packet ids. (Thanks to
	arta for help on this) Added CGameCentre Packet dispatch/packet handling
	hell (Alot of typing =\)
21Dec02 - c0ol
	added splitters to network.cpp loops is now out the window.
20Dec02 - moonshine
	ThreadLoop() has been moved to CChild->Instance(), worked/working on
	various other design aspects.
18Dec02 - moonshine
	ThreadLoop() was eating CPU% when there were no FD_SET()'d sockets, eg.
	no clients in the child. I fixed this by adding a pipe between globals
	and each child (under the suggestion of eurijk), so the children will set
	the piped fd in the loop, and when globals sends data to the socket the
	child will know when a client has arrived (and the select() on the piped
	fd prevents cpu rapage)
17Dec02 - moonshine
	Added CMessageCentre (Handles & dispatches messages to the lower classes
	following:), CFTPCentre (handles ftp sessions), CGameCentre (Handles game
	sessions [eg. bw, w2bn, etc]) and CChatCentre (handles chat bot
	sessions).
17Dec02 - moonshine
	Added Child loop, client's can now return their connection type.  The
	child loop is now ready for packet-seperation hell and CMessageCentre
	should start development ASAP. Added more to Child's RemoveClient(), it
	now closes the client's fd, deincrements their
	# of connections, and deletes the object.
17Dec02 - eurijk@zefga.net
	Fixed potential buffer overflow in log.
	Started a changelog for fun. :)
